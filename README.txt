This is a blended ensembles of classifiers where an ensemble is built up based on the performance of existing classifiers together. 
The ensembles are built of Logistic Regression, SVM and KNN classifiers. 
The classification task is to predict what kind of booking a new customer would make the first time based on his online activity and many other demographical and geographical features.

I discourage any student to use this repository for academic projects/assignments and other academic purposes.
